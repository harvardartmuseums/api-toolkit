## Harvard Art Museums
# API Toolkit and Guide

Over the past few years, new methods of arts research have emerged with the development of technology. To generate research opportunities, many museums have since digitized their collections, allowing the public to access their data. Although the data aims to be conducive to scholarly research, a major barrier remains: accessibility to researchers who do not have a technical background. Thus, in order to address the limitations that many art scholars face when trying to access information that requires coding, the Harvard Art Museums has created a guide which intends to inform individuals with little or no technical background about how to get started with research in the Digital Humanities. Additionally, the guide demonstrates how the Museumâ€™s data can be utilized to solve unanswered research questions.
