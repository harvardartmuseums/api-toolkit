<h2>LESSON 2 OF 6</h2>
<h1>What is an API?</h1>

<div class="lesson-text">

  <p>Standing for application programming interface, an <a href="https://blogs.mulesoft.com/biz/tech-ramblings-biz/what-are-apis-how-do-apis-work/#:~:text=API%20stands%20for%20Application%20Programming,the%20response%20back%20to%20you.">API</a> is a part of a database or server that allows a user to request and send information. For instance, <a href="https://weather.com/swagger-docs/call-for-code">The Weather Channel</a> allows developers to access forecasts as data. Thus, different programs and applications (such as the iPhone Weather app) can retrieve this data through requests.</p>

  <p>The Harvard Art Museums has <a href="https://github.com/harvardartmuseums/api-docs">its own API</a>, accessible and free to all. The museum’s API contains all of its information on artworks, artists, exhibitions, and the categorizations used to describe the two. Its data comes from three sources:</p>


  <table class="datasources">
    <tr>
      <td><div class="icon1"><img src="/images/museumicon.png"></img></div></th>
      <td><div class="icon2"><img src="/images/analyticsicon.png"></img></div></th>
      <td><div class="icon3"><img  src="/images/aiicon.png"></img></div></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="data-display">
        <h5>The Museum System</h5>
        <p>The primary source of data, TMS consists of information manually inputted by museum staff. </p>
      </td>
      <td class="data-display">
        <h5>Google Analytics</h5>
        <p>Used to determine website traffic, Google Analytics data reveals the online view counts for art pieces.</p>
      </td>
      <td class="data-display">
        <h5>Artificial Intelligence</h5>
        <p>Utilizing five different machine vision programs, artificial intelligence data exposes how computers interpret artworks in the collection.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>


  <div class="lightwarning"><b>Warning:</b> As a product of its human nature, the museum’s data is not perfect. Although the Harvard Art Museum’s data spans over 200,000 art pieces, the data within may be incomplete or ambiguous. A living document, it is constantly updated by the museum.</div>

  <br><p>Nevertheless, by recognizing its incongruities, the user can work through messy data to access untold stories and unsolved questions.</p>
